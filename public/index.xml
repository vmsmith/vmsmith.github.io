      <title>A First Look at Memory</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/251205-memory-architecture-intro/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A key to Moneypenny is memory management. An AI assistant is only as useful as what it remembers, what it forgets, and how gracefully it moves between the two.
Before diving into memory itself, I want to distinguish between a program and a project.
A program is an ongoing activity that coordinates multiple efforts in pursuit of a larger, strategic aim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may not have a fixed end date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its outputs are capabilities rather than one-off deliverables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success means: “Did we achieve the long-term benefits we intended?”
A project, by contrast, is aimed at producing a specific outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a defined start and finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its output is a discrete deliverable: a system, a report, an event, a piece of writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success means: “Did we deliver the thing, at quality, within scope?”
Within this framing, the program Moneypenny supports is managing my life, and within that program, I have many projects—some tied to long-term goals, others more tactical or short-lived.
With that foundation, we can talk about the types of memory Moneypenny should support.
It’s helpful to think of them as a pyramid arranged by how quickly they change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent Memory (bottom layer)
This is the slowest-changing, most stable information. It comes in two forms:
a. Personal Foundations
Background elements about me that rarely change: lifelong goals, major values, the structure of my strategic plan, and simple biographical anchors. This layer provides continuity without storing unnecessary detail.
b. Moneypenny’s Operating Foundations
Her persona, her communication style, the rules she follows, and the boundaries I’ve set. These define how she behaves, regardless of the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The origins of Moneypenny</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/first-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The original Moneypenny was meant to be an AI executive assistant to help manage the large amount of information associated with Cletho development. The personal Moneypenny I am developing here is meant to help me manage my own life and the my goals and objectives within it. The initial specific functions of the application are to assist in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing my calendar (which may include connections to other calendars).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a &amp;ldquo;To Do&amp;rdquo; list of things I want or need to do, and sending reminders for specified items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing and managing project plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping a time stamped, searchable journal of specified things I do over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping an time stamped, searchable log of ideas I come up with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recording important decisions, with rationale and context, in an time stamped, searchable log.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an &amp;ldquo;Open Loops&amp;rdquo; list of things other people are responsible for doing, such as returning lent items, doing things they said they&amp;rsquo;d do, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indexing digital artifacts, to wit, keep a record of where media articles, key discussion topics, document summaries, etc. can be found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding and publishing long-term reminders, e.g., such-and-such a subscription is expiring next month, Delaware taxes are due in a month, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing topical research on subjects of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarizing documents and identifying key points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Refining the Site Structure and First Blog Post</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/log/entry-002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I refined several parts of the new Hugo site as I continued building the
public-facing workspace for the Moneypenny and Cletho projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published my first real blog post and verified the local → GitHub Pages
workflow end-to-end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaned up the site navigation by keeping only the sections that make sense
right now: &lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Log&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Decisions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configured the homepage so that it no longer shows the most recent blog post.
The homepage now serves purely as an introduction rather than a blog feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a proper &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; to keep build artifacts like &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; out of
version control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensured the GitHub Actions workflow remains clean and deploys correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is now significantly cleaner, easier to navigate, and better aligned
with the narrative and functional goals of the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Workspace Setup and Deployment</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/log/entry-001/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I published the new public-facing Hugo site that will serve as the working
log and narrative record for the Cletho and Moneypenny projects. This marks the
beginning of the development log.
