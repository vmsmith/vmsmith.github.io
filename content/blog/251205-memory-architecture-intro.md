A key to Moneypenny is memory management. An AI assistant is only as useful as what it remembers, what it forgets, and how gracefully it moves between the two.  

Before diving into memory itself, I want to distinguish between a program and a project. 

A **program** is an ongoing activity that coordinates multiple efforts in pursuit of a larger, strategic aim.    
* It may not have a fixed end date.   
* Its outputs are capabilities rather than one-off deliverables.    
* Success means: “Did we achieve the long-term benefits we intended?”
  
A **project**, by contrast, is aimed at producing a specific outcome.    
* It has a defined start and finish.    
* Its output is a discrete deliverable: a system, a report, an event, a piece of writing.    
* Success means: “Did we deliver the thing, at quality, within scope?”    

Within this framing, the program Moneypenny supports is managing my life, and within that program, I have many projects—some tied to long-term goals, others more tactical or short-lived.

With that foundation, we can talk about the types of memory Moneypenny should support.  It’s helpful to think of them as a pyramid arranged by how quickly they change.    

---    
**1. Persistent Memory (bottom layer)**        
This is the slowest-changing, most stable information. It comes in two forms:    

a. Personal Foundations   
Background elements about me that rarely change: lifelong goals, major values, the structure of my strategic plan, and simple biographical anchors. This layer provides continuity without storing unnecessary detail.    

b. Moneypenny’s Operating Foundations    
Her persona, her communication style, the rules she follows, and the boundaries I’ve set. These define how she behaves, regardless of the topic at hand.

**2. Episodic or Project Memory (middle layer)**   
This is information that changes but persists across time.
Examples include:
* A to-do list that evolves over time   
* A journal that accumulates entries   
* A project log that tracks milestones and progress   
This layer represents the “living record” of what I’m working on.

**3. Session Memory (upper middle layer)**   
Short-term, topic-specific context from a given session.

This might include a small summary of what we were discussing or the next step in a conversation that’s still in progress. Some session details get saved to a project or journal; most fade unless I mark them as important.   

---    

**4. Working Memory (top of the pyramid)**    
This is the most ephemeral layer: the content of the current conversation’s context window—what’s needed to keep the immediate step coherent.
It disappears quickly unless pulled downward into one of the more persistent layers. I will have a lot more to say about this layer in future posts.
