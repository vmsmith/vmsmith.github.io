I got started on Personal Moneypenny this week. Specifically:   

1. Created a git/GitHum repo and the high-level folder structure: 
* `project` project-level artifacts such as architectural decision records (ADRs), planning notes, meta discussions, etc.  
* `governance` for canonical governance artifacts that define semantic commitments, constraints and invariants, evaluation expectations, etc.
* `runtime` for executable code.

I'm holding on a few categories for later:  
* `docs` for such things as user guides.    
* `other` TBD   

2. Created a `persona.md` file that will be the bedrock foundation of Moneypenny, defining what it is, what it must do, and what it cannot do. 

3. Created an `ArtifactChecklist.md` file that will be applied to every artifact—`.md` files, Python files, etc.—to ensure all the five track items were considered.
