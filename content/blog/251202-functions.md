summary: "The initial set of functions for personal Moneypenny"

The initial functions of the application are to assist in are:

1. Managing my **calendar**.   
2. Maintaining a **"To Do" list** of things I want or need to do, and sending reminders for specified items.
3. Helping develop and manage **project plans**.   
4. Keeping a time stamped, searchable **journal** of specified things I do over time.   
5. Keeping an time stamped, searchable **ideas log** to document things I come up with.    
6. Keeping a time stamped, searchable **decision log** to record important decisions, with rationale and context.   
7. Maintaining an **"Open Loops" list** of things other people are responsible for doing, such as returning lent items, doing things they said they'd do, etc.   
8. Creating and maintaining a **digital artifacts library**, to wit, keep a record of where media articles, key discussion topics, document summaries, etc. can be found.   
9. Holding and publishing **long-term reminders**, e.g., such-and-such a subscription is expiring next month, Delaware taxes are due in a month, etc.    
10. Performing **topical research** on subjects of interest.    
11. **Summarizing documents** and identifying key points.    

I am going to try to prevent mission creep here, but I can see one function that I'll want to eventually implement. I think it would be nice to wake up every morning with a summary of what items of interest happened overnight. For example, news about stocks I'm following, or news about government policy changes that might affect me, or flags for imporant emails. I'll have to think about that some more & discuss it with my technical assistants.
