The original Moneypenny was meant to be an AI executive assistant to help manage the large amount of information associated with Cletho development. The personal Moneypenny I am developing here is meant to help me manage my own life and the goals and objectives I have. The initial specific functions of the application are:
1.  Manage my calendar, which may include connections to other calendars.
2.	Maintain a "To Do" list of things I want or need to do.
3.	Track milestones and deliverables related to the “To Do” list, and send reminders for specified items.
4.	Keep a daily time stamped, searchable journal of significant things I do over time.
5.	Maintain an time stamped, searchable log of ideas I come up with.
7.	Record important decisions, with rationale, date, and context, in an time stamped, searchable log.
8.	Maintain an "Action Items" list of things other people are responsible for doing, to include returning lent books, articles, etc. 
9.	Index digital artifacts, to wit, keep a record of where media articles, key discussion topics, document summaries, etc. can be found.
10.	Hold and publish long-term reminders, e.g., such-and-such a subscription is expiring next month, Delaware taxes are due in a month, etc.
11.	Perform topical research on subjects of interest. 
12.	Summarize documents and identify key points.
