The original Moneypenny was meant to be an AI executive assistant to help manage the large amount of information associated with Cletho development. The personal Moneypenny I am developing here is meant to help me manage my own life and the goals and objectives I have. The initial specific functions of the application are:
1.	Maintain a "To Do" list of things I want or need to do.
2.	Track milestones and deliverables related to the “To Do” list.
3.	Keep a daily time stamped, searchable journal of significant things I do on given days.
4.	Maintain an ideas log of ideas I come up with.
5.	Manage my calendar, which may include connections to other calendars.
6.	Record important decisions, with rationale, date, and context.
7.	Maintain an "Action Items" list of things other people are responsible for doing.
8.	Index digital artifacts, to wit, keep a record of where articles, key discussion topics, document summaries, etc. can be found.
9.	Hold and publish long-term reminders, e.g., such-and-such a subscription is expiring next month, Delaware taxes are due in a month, etc.
10.	Perform topical research on subjects of interest. 
11.	Summarize documents and identify key points.
