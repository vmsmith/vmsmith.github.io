The original Moneypenny was meant to be an AI executive assistant to help manage the large amount of information associated with Cletho development. The personal Moneypenny I am developing here is meant to help me manage my own life and the my goals and objectives within it. The initial specific functions of the application are to assist in:   
1.  Managing my calendar (which may include connections to other calendars).
2.	Maintaining a "To Do" list of things I want or need to do, and sending reminders for specified items.
3.	Developing and managing project plans. 
4.	Keeping a time stamped, searchable journal of specified things I do over time.
5.	Keeping an time stamped, searchable log of ideas I come up with.
7.	Recording important decisions, with rationale and context, in an time stamped, searchable log.
8.	Maintaining an "Open Loops" list of things other people are responsible for doing, such as returning lent items, doing things they said they'd do, etc. 
9.	Indexing digital artifacts, to wit, keep a record of where media articles, key discussion topics, document summaries, etc. can be found.
10.	Holding and publishing long-term reminders, e.g., such-and-such a subscription is expiring next month, Delaware taxes are due in a month, etc.
11.	Performing topical research on subjects of interest. 
12.	Summarizing documents and identifying key points.
