I developed a first iteration of a high-level view of the system architecture. It identifies the major components:

* Presentation Layer
* Orchestration Layer
* Cognition subsystem
* LLM
* Runtime environment, consisting of a persistence component and an external services component.

It also shows the interfaces between those commponents: APIs, MCPs, webhooks, function calls, etc.

A diagram and description are in the Architecture section of this website.
