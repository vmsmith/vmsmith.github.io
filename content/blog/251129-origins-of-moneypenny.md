summary: "The motivation to create personal Moneypenny"
---

The original Moneypenny was meant to be an AI executive assistant to help manage the large amount of information associated with Cletho development. As I thought about how I might go about developing an AI EA, I thought that it might be good to develop a personal Moneypenny to help me manage my own life and the my goals and objectives within it. In doing so, I would also learn a lot of things that might be transferable to Clear Thought Labs (CTL) Moneypenny. 

The initial specific functions of the application are to assist in:   
1.  Managing my **calendar**.
2.	Maintaining a **"To Do" list** of things I want or need to do, and sending reminders for specified items.
3.	Developing and managing **project plans**. 
4.	Keeping a time stamped, searchable **journal** of specified things I do over time.
5.	Keeping an time stamped, searchable **ideas log** to document things I come up with.
7.	Recording important decisions, with rationale and context, in an time stamped, searchable **decisions log**.
8.	Maintaining an **"Open Loops" list** of things other people are responsible for doing, such as returning lent items, doing things they said they'd do, etc. 
9.	Creating and maintaining a **digital artifacts library**, to wit, keep a record of where media articles, key discussion topics, document summaries, etc. can be found.
10.	Holding and publishing **long-term reminders**, e.g., such-and-such a subscription is expiring next month, Delaware taxes are due in a month, etc.
11.	Performing topical **research** on subjects of interest.
