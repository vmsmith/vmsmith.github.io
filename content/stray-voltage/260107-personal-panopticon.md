The essay, "[The Molly Cantillon manifesto, A Personal Panopticon](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/the-molly-cantillon-manifesto-a-personal-panopticon.html)," appeared on the website Marginal Revolution. Tyler Cowan said it is "it is likely to be one of the most important essay of the year."

It could be thought of as an ultimate Moneypenny. I asked Chat to comment on it, and the conversation is in the Word doc 260107_260107_Stray-Voltage_Personal-Panopticon.

There is a long way to go before an AI assistant has that level of trust, but it's something to think about.
