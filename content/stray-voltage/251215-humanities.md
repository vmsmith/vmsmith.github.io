Steve Jobs is famous for (among other things) having said, "It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough. It's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing.”

Related to that,  when I worked at Naval Research Laboratory, and was the principal investigator for the DARPA DCA-MANETS project, I asked the recruiter to hire a few people who had a humanities background—to wit, studied philosphy or literature or history or something along those lines—in college and then drifted over into programming later. My thinking, based on an old Robert Reich article on the future of work—was that they would think and communicate differently than the CS and EE people. And that turned out to be exactly the case. When the project ended, the three people who fit that profile were exactly the people who NRL kept on board.

In that spirit, I think I might make it a core tenet of Clear Thought Labs that we hire people who studied liberal arts and humanities in college, and later found themselves in technology. My rationale here is a little different. I think that AI apps of the sort we're building **need** an understanding of human nature, not just knowledge of technology. I might put that somewhere on the CTL website.
