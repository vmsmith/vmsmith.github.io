summary: "A possible next step for Personal Moneypenny to assist in internalizing specified chunks of information"

The essay, "[A Metabolic Workspace](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/a-metabolic-workspace/)," appeared in Joan Westenberg's blog. It suggests not just storing information in a manner 
that allows quick and easy retrieval, but also a process for "digesting" the information that entails "regurgitation" and compression.

This is a bit beyond the current vision of Personal Moneypenny, but it's not in the same league as "A Personal Panopticon" (07 January 2026). I don't think it's something for CTL 
Moneypenny, but for Personal Moneypenny it's definitely soemthing to think about.
