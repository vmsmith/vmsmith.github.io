summary: "Ideas for the AWMYT imperative to sharpen cognitive abilities" 
---   

There was an article in the December 2025 issue of The Atlantic that talked about how use of AI can cause cognitive decline ("The People Outsourcing Their Thinking to AI")

One idea to prevent that was to have the application to tell users to take a break.

Another idea, related to Cletho, would be to have the application "gently" suggest to the user that they think about how to write a better prompt. Do this in a way that nudges the user towards applying/developing their critical thinking skills.
