Reddit user `u/ZeroCool86` made a post about using local models vs the cloud. This is for privacy-conscious users who care about sensitive data. That could very well pertain to Cletho users (or even Moneypenny users). 

Apparently `u/ZeroCool86` is using networked attached storage and an external GPU. A possible middle-ground solution would be for CTL to do that for clients/customers.

Here is the Reddit post:

And here is `u/ZeroCool86`s manifesto (and related site):

It's all something to keep in mind.
