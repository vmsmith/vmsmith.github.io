One challenge with Cletho will be to keep users engaged. The online gaming community seems to have a handle on this, and I was wondering if folding in a gaming engine might be feasible and desirable.

CTL Chat and I had an exchange, and Chat came up with some interesting ideas. Namely, don't think about folding in an actual gaming engine, like Unity. Rather, think about structuring the semantic committments along the lines of a game, e.g., the quest, side quests, progress, rewards, etc.

The entire exchange, as well as a proposed "Quest spec template" is on CTL Chat thread "260102 - Gaming Engline."
