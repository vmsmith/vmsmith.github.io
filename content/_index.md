Welcome to my personal workspace for tracking the development of **Moneypenny** and how it relates to the broader ideas behind Clear Thought Labs (CTL).

In April 2025, I published an article on Substack—[As We May Yet Think](https://12nw.substack.com/p/as-we-may-yet-think)—about how AI applications might serve as thought partners to help human users think more clearly and rationally. Two months later, a friend and I launched CTL to build a first version of such a system.   

It turned out to be far more challenging than I expected. The information load alone was immense: schedules, decisions, design pivots, technical reading, new concepts like RAG and MCP, insights from AI research blogs . . . all of it accumulating faster than I could track or process. It became clear that I needed help managing not just the work, but the information and thinking surrounding the work.    

I imagined an AI executive assistant that I called Moneypenny, named after the iconic Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell in the early Bond films. Moneypenny would help manage information, organize ideas, and serve as a companion in learning the technologies behind our larger project.   

The more I explored the concept, the more I realized I wanted two versions of Moneypenny:       
* a personal version, to help in handling my own life and intellectual workflow, and also to serve as sandbox for experimenting with ideas that might eventually be part of future AI apps.  
* a CTL version, to help in managing the development of products and the running of the organization.

This site serves two purposes:

1. **A working log** for architecture notes, design considerations, and ongoing development. This is primarily for me, to help me keep my thoughts in order and to manage the information load. 
2. **A public window** into the thinking, decisions, and experiments behind the project. This is so others who might be considering developing AI apps can can (hopefully) get some insights into the path for doing that.

Over time, this will grow into a narrative record of the work — part journal, part technical notebook, part story.

Use the menu items above to explore the different areas of the project.
