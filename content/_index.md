Welcome to my personal workspace for tracking the development of 
**Cletho**, **Moneypenny**, and the broader ideas behind Clear Thought Labs.

This site serves two purposes:

1. **A public window** into the thinking, decisions, and experiments behind the project.
2. **A working log** for architecture notes, design considerations, and ongoing development.

Over time, this will grow into a narrative record of the work — part journal,
part technical notebook, part story.

Use the menu items above to explore the different areas of the project.
