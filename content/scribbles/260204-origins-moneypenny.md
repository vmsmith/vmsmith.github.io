The original Moneypenny was meant to be an AI executive assistant to help manage the large amount of information associated with Cletho development. As I thought about how I might go about developing an AI EA, I thought that it might be good to develop a personal Moneypenny to help me manage my own life and the my goals and objectives within it. In doing so, I would also learn a lot of things that might be transferable to CTL Moneypenny and Cletho.

There are two heuristics that inform every project I undertake, and these create tension from the start.

The first heuristic is from the world of [systems architecting](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Systems-Architecting-Engineering/dp/1420079131): "All the really important mistakes are made on the first day." 

Figuratively speaking, the "first day" refers to the earliest decisions that typically involve how we structure the project. And that structure determines most of what happens later. It's when we're setting the rules of the game. A lot of the future pain is just the rules playing out.

I am a systems architect by temperment, training, and background. This heuristic strikes a deep chord in me. I will tend to fiddle around with the earliest decisions, trying to make sure they are as close to perfect as they can be.

Which brings up the second heuristic: "Better is the enemy of good enough."  This is attributed to Sergey Gorshkov, the commander in chief of the Soviet Navy from 1956 to 1985, who managed it’s dramatic expansion during the Cold War.

I've done my fair share of project managing over the years, and I firmly believe in this heuristic, too. This applies more to implementation than to architecting, but I am by nature more of an architect than project manager, and my inclination will always be to fiddle towards perfection. 

So there will be tension on this project, and my challenge will be to know when things are good enough to move on.

The initial specific functions of the application are to assist in:   
1.  Managing my **calendar**.
2.	Maintaining a **"To Do" list** of things I want or need to do, and sending reminders for specified items.
3.	Developing and managing **project plans**. 
4.	Keeping a time stamped, searchable **journal** of specified things I do over time.
5.	Keeping an time stamped, searchable **ideas log** to document things I come up with.
7.	Recording important decisions, with rationale and context, in an time stamped, searchable **decisions log**.
8.	Maintaining an **"Open Loops" list** of things other people are responsible for doing, such as returning lent items, doing things they said they'd do, etc. 
9.	Creating and maintaining a **digital artifacts library**, to wit, keep a record of where media articles, key discussion topics, document summaries, etc. can be found.
10.	Holding and publishing **long-term reminders**, e.g., such-and-such a subscription is expiring next month, Delaware taxes are due in a month, etc.
11.	Performing topical **research** on subjects of interest. 
12.	**Summarizing documents** and identifying key points.
