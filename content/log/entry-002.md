title: "Refining the Site Structure and First Blog Post"

Today I refined several parts of the new Hugo site as I continued building the
public-facing workspace for the Moneypenny and Cletho projects.

Key updates:

- Published my first real blog post and verified the local → GitHub Pages
  workflow end-to-end.
- Cleaned up the site navigation by keeping only the sections that make sense
  right now: **Blog**, **Log**, **Architecture**, and **Decisions**.
- Configured the homepage so that it no longer shows the most recent blog post.
  The homepage now serves purely as an introduction rather than a blog feed.
- Added a proper `.gitignore` to keep build artifacts like `public/` out of
  version control.
- Ensured the GitHub Actions workflow remains clean and deploys correctly.

The site is now significantly cleaner, easier to navigate, and better aligned
with the narrative and functional goals of the project.
