title: "Concepts"
summary: "Supporting concepts and deeper dives extracted from roadmaps and working documents."
---

This section contains focused concept pages that support larger artifacts such as
roadmaps, architectural notes, and design decisions.

The goal is to keep primary documents readable while preserving depth, rationale,
and traceability elsewhere.

Each concept page typically originates in a longer document and links back to its
source context.
