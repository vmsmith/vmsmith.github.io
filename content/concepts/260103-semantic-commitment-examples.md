## Five Examples of Semantic Commitment   
1. Note vs Decision vs Tentative Idea   
2. Memory Promotion
3. Authority Boundaries  

### Example 1: Note vs Decision vs Tentative Idea

#### Situation (Personal Moneypenny)
You say:

“I think we should probably prioritize the Cletho MVP over everything else.”

#### Semantic commitment achieved by:

The system does not immediately store this.

It asks a clarifying question:

“Should I treat this as a tentative idea, or as a decision that should guide future planning?”

#### Commitment outcomes:

* If tentative idea: It may be referenced but not treated as binding.
* If decision: It constrains future prioritization and planning.

Conflicts must be surfaced later.

#### What’s important:
The system does not infer commitment from phrasing. Commitment is explicitly resolved.

### Example 2: Memory Promotion

#### Situation
During a conversation you say:

“I always struggle with open-ended tasks.”

#### Semantic commitment achieved by:

The system distinguishes:

conversational context vs

durable personal knowledge

It responds:

“Do you want me to remember this as a standing preference, or is this just context for this conversation?”

#### Commitment outcomes:

* If remembered: This fact may influence future task framing.
* If not: It expires with the session.

#### Carry-through:
This exact rule still applies in CTL Moneypenny and Cletho.
What changes later is how often the question is triggered—not whether it exists.

### Example 3: Authority Boundaries

#### Situation   
You ask:    
“Just add that to my calendar.”   

#### Semantic commitment achieved by:
The system knows whether it is:    
* advisory   
* executory   

It either:   
* asks for confirmation, or     
* proceeds under previously granted authority

#### Commitment outcomes:   
Calendar writes always have:   
* provenance (“added by system, confirmed by user”)
* reversibility

#### Key point:    
Authority is not inferred from convenience. It is a governed semantic state.
