title: A freighter cruise across The Atlantic

### Preface  

My wife, Ellen, and I travelled from Baltimore, Maryland to Hamburg, Germany on a cargo ship during the summer of 2019.  In preparing for the voyage, I found there to be a dearth of information of any sort available.  This blog is meant to document some of the things we learned before and during the voyage that might help others plan and prepare.  As such, it is meant primarily to be informative (as opposed to entertaining).  Nonetheless, I hope you find it enjoyable reading...

Sometime back in the heyday of alternative lifestyle catalogs -- late-60s/early-70s -- I came across a catalog called "The Great Escape," or something like that.  In it there was an interesting article about traveling by freighter.  I liked it at the time, and although I rarely thought about it over the years, the idea never quite left me.

Then last year I had to occasion to recall it.  

Ellen and I had been living in Paris since the summer of 2018, and we needed to return to the U.S. in late-May 2019 to get new visas.  We had come over on round trip tickets, and had return tickets on hand.  But once we got our new visas, we would only need one-way tickets back to France.

When we looked, the price of a one-way ticket was nuts; it was something like $1,200 each.  So we felt compelled to look for alternatives.  Somewhere in the thought process the idea of traveling by freighter (or cargo ship) popped up, and I started Googling.

The following blog documents the journey from my first e-mail exchange until the day we arrived in Europe. (It is meant to be informative, not entertaining).

### Beginnings: October 2018 – July 2019

I contacted [Colin Hetherington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-hetherington-6658a17/), of [Cargo Ship Voyages](https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com), for the first time on 11 October 2018.  In the absence of any information whatsoever, I had just started Googling.  

My email records show that between then and our embarkation in late-July 2019 we swapped over 130 emails.
