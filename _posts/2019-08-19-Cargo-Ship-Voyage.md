### Preface  

My wife, Ellen, and I travelled from Baltimore, Maryland to Hamburg, Germany on a cargo ship during the summer of 2019.  In preparing for the voyage, I found there to be a dearth of information of any sort available.  This blog is meant to document some of the things we learned before and during the voyage that might help others plan and prepare.  As such, it is meant primarily to be informative (as opposed to entertaining).  Nonetheless, I hope you find it enjoyable reading...

### Background  

Sometime back in the heyday of alternative lifestyle catalogs -- the late-60s and early-70s -- I came across a catalog called "The Great Escape," or something like that. It was loosely modeled on The Whole Earth Catalog, except it focused on providing information about adventures: land adventures, sea adventures, air adventures, nomadic adventures, and a few more categories that I forget.  There was an interesting article in it about traveling by freighter.  I liked it at the time, and although I rarely thought about it over the years, the idea never quite left me.

Then last year I had to occasion to recall it.  

Ellen and I had been living in Paris since the summer of 2018, and we needed to return to the U.S. in late-May 2019 to get new visas.  We had come over on round trip tickets, and had our return tickets to the U.S. on hand.  But once we got our new visas, we would only need one-way tickets back to France.

When we looked, the price of a one-way ticket was nuts; it was something like $1,200 each.  So we felt compelled to look for alternatives.  Somewhere in the thought process the idea of traveling by freighter (or cargo ship) popped up, and I started Googling...  

### Beginnings: October 2018 – July 2019

The initial Google results were a bit scattered and unorganized, but I was fortunate to have noticed a company called [Cargo Ship Voyages](https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com).  I contacted [Colin Hetherington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-hetherington-6658a17/), the Director, for the first time on 11 October 2018.  

My email records show that between our first e-mail and our embarkation in late-July 2019, we swapped over 130 emails. That in itself should be a testament to how confusing it was for us, and how patient Colin was in helping us sort it all out.

I won't describe each and every e-mail; rather, I'll summarize the major points that we were able to sort out:

* Cost/Benefit 

The price of a one-way airline ticket was about $1,300 when we started looking.  That would have been about $2,600 for two tickets, and at least $100 (if not more) for the additional luggage we intended to bring back.

The cost of the cargo ship was approximately the same (maybe a tad more with health insurance).  But we also got two weeks of room and board thrown in, which would have cost us an additional $1,500 or so in Paris.

So on balance, we realized that from a purely financial point of view, the cargo ship was a bit better.

* Choosing an itinerary  

We had a vague notion that all we had to do was tell Colin that we wanted to leave from an East Coast port and land somewhere in Europe. That was a big nope. We had to neck it down to specific embarkation and disembarkation ports.  And we did after a few back-and-forths.  Baltimore, Maryland to Hamburg, Germany was the itinerary that made the most sense.

* Health Insurance

This was complex, and it was one place where Colin really earned his money. He was not allowed to recommend companies, but he gave us the name of a company that he said others had used.  So far, so good. But it turned out to required 4 - 5 applications and cancellations until we finally got all the details right.  Once we had that down, Colin advised us to wait until close to the last minute to actually purchase it in case there were further changes.
