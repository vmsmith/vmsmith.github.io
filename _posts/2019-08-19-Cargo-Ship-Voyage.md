title: A freighter cruise across The Atlantic

### Preface  

My wife, Ellen, and I travelled from Baltimore, Maryland to Hamburg, Germany on a cargo ship during the summer of 2019.  In preparing for the voyage, I found there to be a dearth of information of any sort available.  This blog is meant to document some of the things we learned before and during the voyage that might help others plan and prepare.  As such, it is meant primarily to be informative (as opposed to entertaining).  Nonetheless, I hope you find it enjoyable reading...

### Background  

Sometime back in the heyday of alternative lifestyle catalogs -- the late-60s and early-70s -- I came across a catalog called "The Great Escape," or something like that. It was loosely modeled on The Whole Earth Catalog, except it focused on providing information about adventures: land adventures, sea adventures, air adventures, nomadic adventures, and a few more categories that I forget.  There was an interesting article in it about traveling by freighter.  I liked it at the time, and although I rarely thought about it over the years, the idea never quite left me.

Then last year I had to occasion to recall it.  

Ellen and I had been living in Paris since the summer of 2018, and we needed to return to the U.S. in late-May 2019 to get new visas.  We had come over on round trip tickets, and had our return tickets to the U.S. on hand.  But once we got our new visas, we would only need one-way tickets back to France.

When we looked, the price of a one-way ticket was nuts; it was something like $1,200 each.  So we felt compelled to look for alternatives.  Somewhere in the thought process the idea of traveling by freighter (or cargo ship) popped up, and I started Googling...  

### Beginnings: October 2018 – July 2019

The initial Google results were a bit scattered and unorganized, but I was fortunate to have noticed a company called [Cargo Ship Voyages](https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com).  I contacted [Colin Hetherington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-hetherington-6658a17/), the Director, for the first time on 11 October 2018.  

My email records show that between our first e-mail and our embarkation in late-July 2019, we swapped over 130 emails. That in itself should be a testament to how confusing it was for us, and how patient Colin was in helping us sort it all out.

I won't describe each and every e-mail; rather, I'll summarize the major points that Colin helped us with:

* Choosing an itinerary.

* Health Insurance.

* Rescheduling

* Following the ACL interactive web site….
