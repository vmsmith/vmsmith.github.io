### Preface  

In the summer of 2019, my wife and I travelled from Baltimore, Maryland to Hamburg, Germany on a cargo ship.  During the planning and preparations for this voyage, I found there was not a lot of the sort of information I would liked to have had  available.  This blog is meant to document some of the things we learned before and during the voyage that might help others plan and prepare similar trips.  As such, it is meant primarily to be informative.  Nonetheless, I hope you find it enjoyable as well.

### Background  

Sometime back in the heyday of alternative lifestyle catalogs -- the late-60s and early-70s -- I came across a catalog called "The Great Escape Book," or something like that. It was loosely modeled on The Whole Earth Catalog, except it focused on providing information about adventures: land adventures, sea adventures, air adventures, nomadic adventures, and a few more categories that I forget.  There was an interesting article in it about traveling by freighter.  I liked it at the time, and although I rarely thought about it over the years, the idea never quite left me.

Then last year I had to occasion to recall it.  

Ellen (my wife) and I had been living in Paris since the summer of 2018, and we needed to return to the U.S. in late-May 2019 to get new visas.  We had come over on round trip tickets, and had our return tickets to the U.S. on hand.  But once we got our new visas, we would only need one-way tickets back to France.

When we looked, the price of a one-way ticket was nuts; it was something like $1,200 each.  So we felt compelled to look for alternatives.  Somewhere in the thought process the idea of traveling by freighter (or cargo ship) popped up, and I started Googling...  

### Beginnings: October 2018 – July 2019

The initial Google results were a bit scattered and unorganized, but I was fortunate to have noticed a company called [Cargo Ship Voyages](https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com).  I contacted them via e-mail on 11 October 2018, and reached [Colin Hetherington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-hetherington-6658a17/), the Director.  

My email records show that between that first e-mail and our embarkation in late-July 2019, Colin and I had over 130 exchanges. That in itself should be a testament to how confusing it was for us, and how patient Colin was in helping us sort it all out.

I won't describe each and every e-mail; rather, I'll summarize the major points that we were able to sort out:

* **Cost/Benefit** 

The price of a one-way airline ticket was about $1,300 when we started looking.  That would have been about $2,600 for two tickets, and at least $100 (if not more) for all the additional luggage we intended to bring back.

The cost of the cargo ship was approximately the same, although the required health insurance bumped it up a bit.  But we also got two weeks of room and board thrown in, which would have cost us an additional $1,500 or so in Paris.

So on balance we realized that from a purely financial point of view the cargo ship was a bit better.

* **Choosing an itinerary**  

When we started we had a vague notion that all we had to do was tell Colin that we wanted to leave from an East Coast port and land somewhere in Europe, and that he would provide us with a menu of options from which to choose.  Nope.  We had to neck it down to specific embarkation and disembarkation ports.  And we did that after a few back-and-forths.  Baltimore, Maryland to Hamburg, Germany ended up being the itinerary that made the most sense.

* **Health Insurance**

This was complex, and it was one of those issues where Colin really earned his money.  He was not allowed to recommend companies, but he gave us the name of a company that he said others had used.  So far, so good.  But it turned out to have required 4 - 5 applications and cancellations until we finally got all the details right.  Once we had that down, Colin advised us to wait until close to the last minute to actually purchase it in case there were further changes. (More details on the health insurance thing below.)

* **Rescheduling**  

We had originally booked passage on the Atlantic Sail, scheduled to depart Baltimore on 13 July and arrive in Hamburg on 28 July. As spring advanced and we started looking with more granularity at the various things we needed to be doing in the U.S., we realized that 13 July was probably going to be too tight.  Once again, Colin came through.  He was able to get us rebooked on the Atlantic Sky, which was scheduled to depart Baltimore on 27 July.  

* **Atlantic Container Lines (ACL) interactive web site**

Colin introduced us to the [ACL interactive vessel schedules website](https://www.aclcargo.com/vesselSchedules.php). Although this turned out to be not entirely accurate as we got close to departure, it gave us a warm and fuzzy to at least *think* we were on top of the schedule. And up until the last week it was accurate enough.

And so 130 emails and 9 months later, we had tickets in hand and were ready to go...

### Stray Voltage - Health Insurance  

As I said, the health insurance thing was a bit complex.  We had to have insurance from 10 days before the earliest departure of the ship until 10 days after the latest arrival.

Blah, blah, blah...

### Wed, 11 July

According to the ACL interactive web site, we are due to arrive in Hamburg now on 11 August.  In the absence of any other information, Ellen and I booked a room in Hamburg for a few days starting 11 August, and arranged a rental car through AAA in Virginia.  We planned to spend a few days in Hamburg, pick up the car on 14 August, spend that night somewhere in Belgium, and arrive in Paris on the 15th.

There were some uncertainties at this point that were gnawing at us.  Specifically:

* How would we get to the ship in Baltimore?  Would our rides be able to enter the port and drive us there?  And how would we get all of our luggage onboard?

* How would immigration and customs work in Hamburg?

* How could be contact the hotel if our arrival time changed while we were underway?

* How would we get from the ship to our hotel in Hamburg?  Would there be a phone onboard that we could use?

We didn't stay awake at night staring at the ceiling and wondering how we would get our luggage onboard, but these uncertainties did produce a certain amount of anxiety. Yada yada yada...

### Thu, 19 July

I called ACL for the first time and spoke with someone who said that an organization called Norton Lilly would actually be providing details such as time, location, etc., for our embarkation.  Apparently Norton Lilly is ACL’s local agent.  Norton Lilly would also make sure our names are at the terminal gate so we can get in, and they would make sure we had transportation from the gate to the ship. 

I called Norton Lilly and the operator I spoke to said that the agent handling the Atlantic Sky was not in, and that I needed to call back.

I would add that at this point the ship’s departure had changed several times.  It fell back to 2:00 am on Tuesday, 30 July at one point, then moved up to Monday, 29 July.

### Tue, 23 July

I called Norton Lilly again, and again was told that the agent I needed to speak to was not in.  This time the operator took my name and phone number and said he’d have the agent call back.

The operator also took the time to discuss the ship’s schedule.  When I told him it was currently scheduled to depart on Sunday, 28 July he laughed.  He said that in the shipping business that’s a lifetime, and that we really won’t know for a few more days.

### Thu, 25 July

I called Norton Lilly and finally got through to the person I needed to talk to.  His name is Walter Celario.  Before I reached Walter, however, I talked to some guy named Gordon who had answered the phone.  Gordon was friendly and as helpful as he could be (given that the Atlantic Sky wasn’t his thing).  In the course of the conversation, when I mentioned that ACL told me we’d need an escort from the gate to the ship, he mused out loud, “I wonder who’s going to pay for that?”  That did not give me a warm and fuzzy.

Well, Walter answered that question: Ellen and I were going to pay.  It would be about $55, which is no big deal but still a bit of a surprise (and, as I learned later, probably a bit of a scam).

That aside, Walter said the ship was supposed to arrive at about 4:00 am on Monday, 29 July, and depart about 24 hours later.  He told us we should be there to board at noon on the 29th, and he gave me the address of the gate at the Dundark Marine Terminal.

Walter also gave me his cell phone number and an e-mail address.  I gave him my cell and e-mail, and he said he’d be in touch with additional information.

### Fri, 26 July

I sent Walter an e-mail with a copy of our Atlantic Sky ticket, as well as a recap of what I understood him to have said yesterday.  Walter replied almost immediately that a 12:00 pm arrival was correct, because there would be no loading activity going on at that time.  It was good to know he checks his e-mail and was taking us seriously.

I also called ACL to ask a few questions about things related to our arrival in Hamburg.  I figured since Norton Lilly is just a local agent for Baltimore, no one there would have any knowledge about Hamburg, but that ACL might.

I spoke with a guy named Kristopher who really made my day.  He was smart and patient, and he made a real effort to explain things to me and answer what he could.  The things I took away from that conversation were the following:

* There might not be any Internet connectivity on the ship, but we could debark at the various ports (e.g., Liverpool) and contact our hotel in Hamburg to modify reservations as necessary.
* If the ship arrives in Hamburg at, say, 1:00 am, we will not be obliged to disembark at that point.  We will almost certainly be able to sleep through the night and disembark the following morning.
* From a customs/passport control point of view, we will be treated like crew.  We will probably fill out forms and give them to the Master, and then the customs people will come on board to review things.  
* The crew will help us with our luggage.

Kristopher also confirmed that the Atlantic Sky will be pier side on Monday, 29 July, even though the interactive online website was not reflecting that.

I’ll add at this point that I had been wondering about the relationship between ACL and Grimaldi.  What I came to understand later -- which may be inaccurate -- is that ACL used to be its own company, but after the 2008 economic collapse it had been acquired by Grimaldi.  My understanding is that Grimaldi is a global shipping company, and that ACL basically handles all, or a large part of, the Atlantic shipping.  There might be an analogous company in the Pacific that handles Pacific trade, and one in the Mediterranean, and so on.  

### Sun, 28 July

Walter sent me a text asking for our names and ID numbers so he could arrange for us to get in Dundark terminal.  I took this to be a sign that he’s on top of it, and I felt good.


### Stray Voltage – Maritime Terminology

For those of you who do not have much nautical experience, here are some common maritime vocabulary terms I will be using:

Port – the left side of the ship
Starboard – the right side of the ship

Bow – the front of the ship
Stern – the rear of the ship

Fore – towards the front of the ship
Aft – towards the rear of the ship

Beam – the side of a ship.  Thus, the port beam is the left side of the ship, and the starboard beam is the right side of the ship.

Bulkhead – a wall
Ladder – a stairway
Head – the bathroom/restroom

Also, I will be using the 24-hour clock to note times from here on out.
